# Animated Algorithm Explanations

## About The Project

This repository contains a collection of animations created to explain various algorithms. Using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), a powerful Python library for mathematical animations, each script in this repository breaks down complex algorithms into engaging, easy-to-understand visualizations. This project aims to make learning algorithms more accessible and intuitive, especially for visual learners and beginners in computer science.

## Getting Started

To get started with these animations, you'll need to set up Manim on your system. Follow the instructions on the [Manim Installation Guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) to install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Manim library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pxd222PranavDhinakar/Algorithms.git
   ```
2. Install Manim:
   ```sh
   pip install manim
   ```

## Usage

There are various jupyter notebooks in the repository that contain the code for each animation. The notebooks run their scripts themselves so all you need to do in install the manim animation library and run the cells in the notebook.

```sh
pip install manim
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you wish to run.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the existing animations or to add new ones are always welcome! If you have a suggestion that would improve this project, please fork the repository and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!
