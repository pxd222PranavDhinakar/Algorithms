    "Creating an animated logo in Manim for your YouTube channel \"P to NP\" sounds like an exciting project. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create such a logo with divided sections representing P-level and NP-level complexities:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Setting up the Rounded Box**\n",
    "   - Use Manim's `RoundedRectangle` class to create a rounded box.\n",
    "   - Specify the height, width, and corner radius to your preference.\n",
    "   - You can also choose a color for the border of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Dividing the Box into Two Sections**\n",
    "   - Use the `Line` class to draw a vertical line down the middle of the rectangle.\n",
    "   - This line will divide the box into two sections representing P and NP complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Illustrating P-level Complexity (Left Side)**\n",
    "   - For the P-level complexity, you might want to depict something orderly and solvable in polynomial time.\n",
    "   - An idea could be to show a simple maze or a sorted array of numbers.\n",
    "   - Use shapes like squares, circles, or arrows to represent the ordered, solvable nature of P problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Illustrating NP-level Complexity (Right Side)**\n",
    "   - NP-level complexity can be illustrated with something more complex or seemingly unsolvable at first glance.\n",
    "   - Consider using a complex graph, a jigsaw puzzle, or an unsolved Rubik's cube.\n",
    "   - The shapes here can be more intricate and interwoven, indicating complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Adding Text Labels**\n",
    "   - Use the `Text` class to add labels \"P\" and \"NP\" to the respective sides of the box.\n",
    "   - You may also add a brief description or a catchy phrase that relates to algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Animating the Logo**\n",
    "   - Utilize various animation classes like `FadeIn`, `GrowFromCenter`, or `DrawBorderThenFill` to animate the entrance of each element.\n",
    "   - You can also animate the division line and the transformation from P to NP to make it dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Adding Final Touches**\n",
    "   - Consider adding some background music or sound effects if the logo animation is standalone.\n",
    "   - Tweak the timing, colors, and transitions to ensure the logo is engaging and represents the theme of your channel effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Exporting the Animation**\n",
    "   - Once you are satisfied with the animation, export it in a suitable format for your YouTube channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, Manim requires a good understanding of Python programming. If you're new to Manim, start with simpler animations to get a feel for how the library works. Good luck with your \"P to NP\" YouTube channel!"
